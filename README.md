# Student's money

NOT COMPLETED

This is my first big app.
The purpose of creating this is to reinforce and improve my knowledge of Android developing and Java.

Actually, this is the 4-rd version of the app.

History of creating:

**0.0.1** The very first try. I had accomplished the first 40 lessons on this site (here should be ref) and started creating something by myself. 
I realised all stuff, that is mentioned in lessons - buttons, TextViews, Layouts, intents, SQLite databases etc.

**0.0.2** I realised how ... bad it was. I rewrote (started new project) the structure: I paid attention to architecture.

**0.0.3** In one moment of development, my program crashed for no reason, so I decided to rewrite project again. 
I had understood much more things and stop coping parts of code that are made by Google. (Ha-ha, no)

**0.1.0** **Now, this is the last release.** I discovered Material Design for myself and now it looks much much better.
